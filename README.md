# Data Challenge
**The Quest**\
You'll start with two treasures:

-   A **CSV dataset** (your raw material)

-   A **data dictionary** (your map)

**Steps to Conquer the Challenge**

1.  **Load & Inspect**

    -   Crack open the data, get to know it.

2.  **Data Cleaning**

    -   Tidy it up: handle missing values, fix quirks, make it analysis-ready.

3.  **Analysis & Answers**\
    With your cleaned dataset, answer:

    -   **Q1.** Average `G3` by sex and school (table).

    -   **Q2.** Who are the high achievers? (G3 > 90th percentile --- list school, sex, age, G1/G2/G3).

    -   **Q3.** Correlations among G1, G2, G3. Which prior grade predicts G3 best?

    -   **Q4.** Alcohol & grades: Compare G3 across Dalc and Walc levels; spot any patterns.

4.  **Visual Glory (Q5)** --- Create three charts:

    -   Bar chart: count of students by school and sex.

    -   Box plot: G3 by Walc level.

    -   Scatter: G1 vs G3 with trendline.

**Deliverables**

-   A short write-up (1--2 pages) **OR** a clearly commented notebook section covering:

    -   Cleaning choices & assumptions

    -   Answers to Q1--Q4

    -   The three charts from Q5

-   Reproducible code (Jupyter Notebook)
